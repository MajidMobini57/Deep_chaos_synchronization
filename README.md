# Welcome to GitHub

In this study, we address the problem of chaotic synchronization over a noisy channel by
introducing a novel Deep Chaos Synchronization (DCS) system using a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). Conventional Deep Learning (DL) based communication strategies are extremely powerful but
training on large data sets is usually a difficult and time-consuming procedure. To tackle this challenge,
DCS does not require prior information or large data sets. In addition, we provide a novel Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN)-based chaotic synchronization system for comparative analysis. The results show
that the proposed DCS architecture is competitive with RNN-based synchronization in terms of robustness
against noise, convergence, and training. Hence, with these features, the DCS scheme will open the door
for a new class of modulator schemes and meet the robustness against noise, convergence, and training
requirements of the Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) and Industrial Internet of
Things (IIoT).

## Describe your project

This article presents the first attempt of using DL in chaos-
based communication systems with providing an excellent
synchronization between two coupled Lorenz systems. The
results showed that the DCS reduces the synchronization
error compared to the traditional systems and RNN-based
approach. Moreover, the proposed DCS is easy to imple-
ment since it does not require training on large data sets.
Thus, it can be used in coherent wireless communication
scenarios where users or mobile units are generally hard
to train. Practical implementations of DCS-based applica-
tions, e.g., chaos-based CDMA systems and low latency
communications is an interesting topic for future researches
